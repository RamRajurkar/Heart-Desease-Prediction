# Multiple Heart Diseases Prediction Project

This project is a Streamlit web application for predicting multiple heart diseases, including diabetes and heart disease. It utilizes machine learning models trained on relevant datasets to make predictions based on user inputs.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Users can input factors such as number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, etc., and the application will predict the likelihood of diabetes.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Users can input factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, etc., and the application will predict the presence of heart disease.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RamRajurkar/Heart-Desease-Prediction.git
   cd Heart-Desease-Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Models Used

- **Diabetes Prediction Model**: Trained on a dataset containing information about pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc., to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
- **Heart Disease Prediction Model**: Trained on a dataset containing various factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, etc., to predict the presence of heart disease.
